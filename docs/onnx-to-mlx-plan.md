# Plan: replace the Swift MLX backend with an ONNX→MLX graph interpreter

Status: **Phase-1 interpreter runs the full graph on MLX CPU** · Last updated: 2026-06-10

## TL;DR

storytime currently carries **two** definitions of the Kokoro model:

1. `assets/kokoro.onnx` — the exported compute graph, run via ONNX Runtime + the
   CoreML execution provider. Correct, but in practice runs **on CPU** on Apple
   Silicon (CoreML EP can't take this graph's ops onto ANE/GPU, so it fragments
   and falls back).
2. `mlx-backend/` — a **hand-written re-implementation** of the same model in
   Swift on top of MLXNN (~1130 LOC of model code + the MLXNN dependency +
   ~90 lines of fragile Swift-runtime linking in `cli/build.rs`), so that the
   model can run on the Metal GPU.

Maintaining two definitions of the same model is the problem. The plan is to
**delete the second definition** and instead **interpret the ONNX graph directly
against MLX core** via [mlx-c](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-c), loading the
weights that already live in the `.onnx`. The `.onnx` becomes the single source
of truth; MLXNN and the Swift port are no longer needed.

This works because **the ONNX graph is already lowered below the layer
abstraction** — there is no `Linear`/`Conv1d`/`LSTM` *layer* to re-implement,
only primitive ops (`Gemm`, `MatMul`, `Conv`, `InstanceNormalization`, …). We
write an **op-level interpreter** (~55 op kernels, most trivial), not a model.

## Why MLX (and why CoreML fails)

The graph has **dynamic sequence length** (`input_ids[1, tokens]` →
`audio[samples]`), an **`LSTM`**, **control flow** (`Loop`/`If`), and **Sequence
(list-of-tensor)** values. CoreML's EP supports a limited static op set and bails
to CPU on the rest; once the graph fragments, the whole thing is effectively CPU.
MLX runs everything on the Metal GPU in eager mode with native dynamic shapes —
which is exactly the capability gap that motivated the Swift backend in the first
place. We keep that capability but drop the redundant model definition.

## Homework: what's actually in `kokoro.onnx`

Inspected with `onnx` (in `export/.venv`). See "Reproduce the analysis" below.

### Shape
- `ir_version 8`, single `ai.onnx` **opset 17**, **no custom domains**.
- **4765 nodes**, **60 distinct op types**, **5 subgraphs** (control-flow bodies).
- Inputs: `input_ids[1, tokens]`, `style[1, 256]`, `speed[1]`. Output: `audio[samples]`.

### Weights
- **443 initializers, 81,148,592 params, all fp32, all internal** (no external
  data). The `.onnx` is the single weight source — 81M × 4 B = ~325 MB. The
  per-voice `style[1,256]` tensor is a runtime input (today's `voices/*.bin`),
  not a graph weight.

### Op inventory (full, by frequency)

  1 And              1 Atan         1 Exp           1 Cos
```

Notes:
- **No `STFT`/`DFT`/`MelSpectrogram` op.** The ISTFTNet vocoder is decomposed into
  `Conv`/`MatMul`/`Sin`/`Cos`; noise excitation is `RandomNormalLike`/
  `RandomUniformLike`. We don't even need `MLXFFT`.

### Control flow (the part that decides "interpreter vs flat translator")
Turned out **bounded and simple**:
- **1 `Loop`** — body is 18 nodes (`SequenceAt`/`Expand`/`Where`/`Reshape`/
  `SequenceInsert`/…). This is the **duration-based length regulator**: trip
  count = token count (bounded, known at runtime), expands each token by its
  predicted duration into a sequence accumulator, then `ConcatFromSequence`. No
  nesting, no unbounded autoregression.
- **2 `If`** — both degenerate: `{Constant, Squeeze}` vs `{Identity}` (a
  conditional squeeze of a size-1 dim).
- **Sequence ops** (`SplitToSequence`/`SequenceEmpty`/`SequenceAt`/
  `SequenceInsert`/`ConcatFromSequence`) implement the list-of-tensors
  accumulator around the loop.

⇒ The interpreter needs only: bounded-loop execution, a list-of-tensors value
type, and a trivial conditional. A few hundred lines, **not** a general ONNX
control-flow engine.

## mlx-c coverage verification

Checked the mlx-c headers (`mlx/c/ops.h`, `fast.h`, `random.h`) — repo at MLX
**0.31.2** bindings. Every non-trivial op maps:

| ONNX op | mlx-c | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Conv` | `mlx_conv1d` / `mlx_conv_general` | direct |
| `ConvTranspose` | `mlx_conv_transpose1d` / `mlx_conv_general` | `conv_general` exposes `stride`, asymmetric `padding_lo`/`padding_hi`, `kernel_dilation`, **`input_dilation`** → covers every ONNX Conv/ConvTranspose attr combo incl. groups |
| `InstanceNormalization` | `mlx_mean`+`mlx_var`+`mlx_rsqrt` | trivial compose (no fused op) |
| `LayerNormalization` | `mlx_fast_layer_norm` | **fused**; nullable weight/bias + eps matches ONNX |
| `LSTM` | `mlx_addmm`/`matmul`+`sigmoid`+`tanh`+`split`/`slice`/`concatenate` | hand-written recurrence |
| `ScatterND` | `mlx_scatter` | |
| `ScatterElements` | `mlx_put_along_axis` | |
| `TopK` | `mlx_topk` | direct |
| `CumSum` | `mlx_cumsum` | |
| `Where` | `mlx_where` | |
| `RandomNormalLike` / `RandomUniformLike` | `mlx_random_normal` / `mlx_random_uniform` | |
| `Expand` | `mlx_broadcast_to` | |
| `Pad` | `mlx_pad` | |
| `Gather` | `mlx_take` / `mlx_take_axis` | (really trivial tier) |
| **`Resize`** | **only gap — decomposes** | see below |

### The `Resize` gap collapses
No native interpolation op in mlx-c (it's an MLXNN `Upsample` layer, not a core
op). The 6 actual nodes are benign:
- **4 nodes**: `nearest`/`asymmetric`/`floor`, integer scale ×2 or ×300 on the
  last axis → **`mlx_repeat`**, a one-liner.
- **2 nodes**: `linear`/`half_pixel`, but **constant** scale (1/300 and 300).
  Constant scale ⇒ precompute a fixed interpolation matrix once and apply as
  **`mlx_matmul`**.

So even the gap is a small, fully-static kernel — no dynamic interpolation engine.

### Caveat
Header inspection proves the ops **exist**, not that semantics are **identical**
(LSTM gate ordering, scatter index conventions, conv pad ordering, `half_pixel`
math). Those are pinned down by per-op parity tests in Phase 0, where existence
becomes proven-correctness.

## Translation effort: three tiers

| Tier | Share | Work |
|---|---|---|
| Trivial 1:1 | ~85% of nodes | `Add`, `Mul`, `MatMul`, `Gemm`, `Transpose`, `Reshape`, `Concat`, `Slice`, `Gather`, `Cast`, `Sqrt`, `Pow`, `Sin`, `Where`, `Range`, `Softmax`, `Tanh`, `LeakyRelu`, … → one mlx-c call each |
| Real kernel (~15 ops) | — | `Conv`/`ConvTranspose`, `InstanceNormalization`, `LayerNormalization`, `Resize`, `LSTM`, scatter/`TopK`/`CumSum` — composed; attribute mapping is where care goes |
| Control flow (~5 ops) | — | `Loop` (bounded), `If` (trivial), Sequence value type — small interpreter |

## Target architecture

- **Rust + mlx-c**, via `bindgen`. The interpreter lives in the Rust CLI; **no
  Swift, no C++ written by us, no MLXNN**. `@_cdecl` and the Swift-runtime
  linking in `build.rs` are deleted.
- Parse the `.onnx` protobuf (Rust: `prost`/`protobuf`, or shell the existing
  Python once to pre-bake initializers — TBD in Phase 0).
- Materialize the 443 initializers as `mlx_array`s once at init.
- Topologically interpret nodes → `mlx_array` ops; handle the loop/if/sequence
  values explicitly.
- Reuse the existing Rust `tokenize()` for `input_ids` (don't re-derive the vocab).
- `build.rs` collapses to: build/link mlx-c + the mlx core static lib + Metal
  frameworks. (mlx-c links its own matching mlx core, so the `vendor/mlx-swift`
  submodule version stops mattering and can eventually be removed.)

### Why this beats the alternatives
- vs **Swift status quo**: single source of truth (`.onnx`), no model drift, no
  MLXNN, no Swift toolchain in the build, generalizes to future Kokoro re-exports.
- vs **C++ bridge** (earlier idea): that was blocked by "MLX has no C++ nn
  library, so reimplement MLXNN." The interpreter **dissolves that blocker** —
  no nn library needed in any language, because the graph is pre-lowered.

## Phase-0 spike results (PASSED)

Run on an Apple M2 Max. Spike lives in `spike/` (gitignored); reproduce as below.

**Outcome: GO.** Both highest-risk kernels reproduce ONNX Runtime CPU to float32
epsilon, and Rust links mlx-c cleanly.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Build mlx-c + mlx core (CPU-only, `MLX_BUILD_METAL=OFF`) | ✅ `libmlxc.a` + `libmlx.a`, example runs |
| ONNX Runtime CPU reference: 4756 intermediate tensors dumped for a fixed input | ✅ `spike/ref_tensors.npz` (audio rms 0.050) |
| **Conv1d** parity (`/F0.0/conv1/Conv`, NCL↔NLC + weight `[Cout,Cin,K]→[Cout,K,Cin]`) | ✅ **rel 6.5e-7** |
| **LSTM** parity (`/text_encoder/lstms.0`, bidirectional, hidden=256, `iofc` gate order) | ✅ **rel 2.7e-7** |
| Rust → mlx-c link + compute (`mlx_add`, hand-declared externs) | ✅ verified |

### Gotchas discovered (carry into Phase 1–2)
- **Lazy transposes are strided views.** `mlx_array_data_float32` exposes the
  underlying (pre-transpose) buffer, so a transposed result reads back wrong.
  Call `mlx_contiguous(..., allow_col_major=false)` before reading raw data (or
  before any step that assumes row-major memory). This was the entire initial
  Conv mismatch.
- **`mlx_dtype` enum: `MLX_FLOAT32 = 10`** (9 is `MLX_FLOAT16`). bindgen will get
  this right; don't hand-hardcode.
- **`mlx_array`/`mlx_stream` are single-`void*` structs** passed/returned by
  value — maps to a `#[repr(C)]` one-pointer struct in Rust; the AArch64 ABI
  handles it.
- **Conv weight layout**: ONNX `[Cout,Cin,K]` → MLX `[Cout,K,Cin]` (transpose
  axes `0,2,1`); input ONNX `[N,Cin,L]` → MLX `[N,L,Cin]`. MLX conv is
  cross-correlation (matches ONNX), no kernel flip.
- **LSTM**: ONNX gate order is **`iofc`**; per-direction `bias = Wb + Rb`;
  backward direction processes timesteps reversed; `Y` is `[seq, num_dir, batch,
  hidden]`. Confirmed exact.
- **GPU build needs the Metal toolchain**: `xcodebuild -downloadComponent
  MetalToolchain` (separate, on recent Xcode). CPU-only build skips it and is
  sufficient for parity work; the production backend needs the GPU build.

## Phase-1 results (interpreter complete, CPU)

A full ONNX→MLX graph interpreter now runs the **entire** `kokoro.onnx` on MLX
CPU and produces audio. Lives in `spike/` (source tracked; build artifacts and
generated safetensors gitignored).

**Pipeline:**
- `spike/lower.py` — one ONNX Runtime CPU pass: folds Constants, emits
  `graph.json` (topo node IR incl. Loop/If subgraphs), `weights.safetensors`
  (1892 tensors, scalars kept rank-0), and `ref.safetensors` (4694 intermediates
  for node-by-node parity).
- `spike/interp/` — Rust + bindgen over mlx-c. Loads the IR + weights, runs each
  node on mlx-c, validates **every** float32 *and* int output against the ONNX
  reference, stops/logs on divergence. All 56 op types implemented (elementwise,
  shape/structural, Gemm/Conv/ConvTranspose/Norms/LSTM, Gather/Scatter/TopK,
  Resize, Pad, and the `SplitToSequence`/`Loop`/`If`/`ConcatFromSequence` length
  regulator).

**Parity status:** the entire deterministic network — embeddings, the PL-BERT
encoder, both bidirectional LSTMs, the prosody/duration predictor, F0/N
predictors, the length-regulator Loop, and the decoder up to the vocoder — matches
ONNX Runtime CPU to **< 5e-4 relative**. Final audio is **rel 1.9e-2**.

The residual is isolated to the **harmonic-source oscillator + iSTFT phase** in
the vocoder: `sin()` of a few-hundred-radian accumulated phase amplifies ~6e-6
relative phase error to ~3.5e-3, and the `atan2` phase reconstruction (expressed
as `Div`→`Atan`→`Where`) further amplifies it where the STFT real part is near
zero. This is **inherent f32 non-associativity between two independent
implementations, not a bug** — it cannot be removed without bit-matching ONNX's
exact summation/rounding through the oscillator. Perceptually 1.9e-2 (≈ −34 dB)
is indistinguishable.

**Bugs found and fixed along the way (each caught by node-level parity):**
- `np.ascontiguousarray` forces ndim≥1 → silently turned rank-0 scalar constants
  (Gather indices) into `(1,)`, corrupting ONNX rank propagation. Fixed in lower.py.
- mlx-c safetensors **iterator** value handle aliases across iterations → fetch
  by name with `get` instead.
- `mlx_softmax` reduces the whole array; need `mlx_softmax_axis`.
- `mlx_concatenate` has no axis; need `mlx_concatenate_axis`.
- ONNX `Div` on **integer** inputs truncates toward zero; `mlx_divide` is float
  (this was the seed of nearly all upstream drift — fixing it dropped the whole
  network to <5e-4).
- ONNX `Gather` = `np.take(axis)`; implemented on host (mlx take/take_axis
  semantics didn't match for multi-dim data).
- Negative-step `Slice` (reverse): ONNX's "past the beginning" end sentinel
  doesn't map to mlx slice stop → host slice for negative steps.
- `ConvTranspose` grouped weight layout: ONNX `[Cin, Cout/g, K]` → MLX
  `[Cout, K, Cin/g]` needs a grouped reshape+permute, not a plain transpose.
- `mlx_pad` supports only constant/edge → host implementation for `reflect`.
- RNG nodes (`RandomUniformLike`/`RandomNormalLike`) are unseeded/nondeterministic
  → inject the captured reference outputs for parity (production uses mlx_random).

**Still to do for a production CPU backend:** native ONNX parsing in Rust (drop
the Python lower step), array lifetime management (the spike leaks), use
mlx_scatter/device ops instead of host fallbacks (Gather/Scatter/Slice/Pad/TopK),
and wire it into the CLI behind `--backend mlx`.

## Phased plan

- **Phase 0 — spike / go-no-go. ✅ DONE — PASSED** (see "Phase-0 spike results").
  Built mlx-c CPU-only, dumped the ONNX CPU reference, and proved Conv1d + the
  bidirectional LSTM match to float32 epsilon, plus Rust↔mlx-c linkage. The
  kill-switch (shaky LSTM/Conv parity) did not trigger.
- **Phase 1 — op kernels + interpreter. ✅ DONE** (see "Phase-1 results"). Full
  graph runs on MLX CPU; deterministic network matches ONNX to <5e-4, audio 1.9e-2
  (residual = inherent oscillator/iSTFT f32 conditioning).
- **Phase 2 — graph interpreter. ✅ folded into Phase 1.** Topological executor +
  bounded `Loop`/`If`/Sequence support implemented and verified.
- **Phase 3 — integrate + strip Swift.** Replace `synthesize_mlx`/`mlx_ffi` to
  call the interpreter; rewrite `build.rs`; keep `mlx-backend/` behind the flag
  until parity passes.
- **Phase 4 — parity gate.** RMS/byte-diff vs current Swift output **and** vs ONNX
  across a fixed phoneme/voice matrix. On pass, delete `mlx-backend/` and the
  Swift linking.

**Effort estimate:** Phases 1–2 dominate; ~1.5–3 weeks, most of it parity-chasing
on Conv/ConvTranspose, LSTM, and the `Resize` linear kernel.

## Open questions / risks
- ONNX parsing in Rust (`prost` vs pre-baking initializers via Python) — decide in Phase 0.
- mlx-c (0.31.2) vs `vendor/mlx-swift` (0.31.4) version reconciliation — pin mlx-c to its matching core; submodule becomes irrelevant.
- Exact semantic parity on LSTM gate order, scatter conventions, `half_pixel` Resize — covered by per-op tests.
- mlx-c build packaging (static lib vendoring vs CMake fetch in `build.rs`).
